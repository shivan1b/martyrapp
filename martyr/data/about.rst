Sardar Vallabhbai Patel
=============================


**Childhood & Early Life**


Vallabhbhai Patel was born on October 31, 1875 in Nadiad village of modern day Gujarat to Zaverbhai and Ladbai. Vallabhbhai, his father had served in the army of the Queen of Jhansi while his mother was a very spiritual woman.


Starting his academic career in a Gujarati medium school, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel later shifted to an English medium school. In 1897, at age of 22 Vallabhbhai passed his high school and started preparing for law examination. He went to pursue a degree in law and travelled to England in 1910. He completed his law degree in 1913 from Inns of Court and came back to India to start his law practice in Godhra, Gujarat. For his legal proficiency, Vallabhbhai was offered many lucrative posts by the British Government but he rejected all. He was a staunch opponent of the British government and its laws and therefore decided not to work for the British

In 1891 he married Zaverbai and the couple had two children. 

Patel shifted his practice to Ahmedabad. He became a member of the Gujarat Club where he attended a lecture by Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi’s words deeply affected Vallabhbai and he soon adopted Gandhian principles to become a staunch follower of the charismatic leader.


In 1909 Patel's wife Jhaverba was hospitalised in Bombay (now Mumbai) to undergo a major surgical operation for cancer. Her health suddenly worsened and, despite successful emergency surgery, she died in the hospital. Patel was given a note informing him of his wife's demise as he was cross examining a witness in court. According to witnesses, Patel read the note, pocketed it, and continued to intensely cross examine the witness and won the case. He broke the news to others only after the proceedings had ended.[10] Patel decided against marrying again. He raised his children with the help of his family and sent them to English medium schools in Mumbai. At the age of 36 he journeyed to England and enrolled at the Middle Temple Inn in London. Completing a 36 month course in 30 months, Patel finished at the top of his class despite having had no previous college background.[11]


**Role in the Indian National Movement**

Was titled ‘Sardar’:
In 1928, he mobilized people of the Bardoli district, which was hit by famine and a 30 percent increase in taxes. The satyagraha led to the British giving into their demands and he was then bestowed with the title ‘Sardar (leader) by his colleagues



As Gandhi embarked on the Dandi Salt March, Patel was arrested in the village of Ras and was put on trial without witnesses, with no lawyer or pressman allowed to attend. Patel's arrest and Gandhi's subsequent arrest caused the Salt Satyagraha to greatly intensify in Gujarat – districts across Gujarat launched an anti tax rebellion until and unless Patel and Gandhi were released.[26] Once released, Patel served as interim Congress president, but was re arrested while leading a procession in Mumbai. After the signing of the Gandhi–Irwin Pact, Patel was elected president of Congress for its 1931 session in Karachi – here the Congress ratified the pact and committed itself to the defence of fundamental rights and human freedoms, and a vision of a secular nation with a minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Patel used his position as Congress president to organise the return of confiscated land to farmers in Gujarat.[27] Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhi and Patel were arrested in January 1932 when the struggle re opened, and imprisoned in the Yeravda Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Patel and Gandhi grew close to each other, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness. Their mutual relationship could be described as that of an elder brother (Gandhi) and his younger brother (Patel). Despite having arguments with Gandhi, Patel respected his instincts and leadership. During imprisonment, the two discussed national and social issues, read Hindu epics, and cracked jokes. Gandhi also taught Patel Sanskrit. Gandhi's secretary, Mahadev Desai, kept detailed records of conversations between Gandhi and Patel.[28] When Gandhi embarked on a fast unto death protesting the separate electorates allocated for untouchables, Patel looked after Gandhi closely and himself refrained from partaking of food.[29] Patel was later moved to a jail in Nasik, and refused a British offer for a brief release to attend the cremation of his brother Vithalbhai, who had died in 1934. He was finally released in July of the same year.



**Quit India Movement**

On the outbreak of World War II, Patel supported Nehru's decision to withdraw the Congress from central and provincial legislatures, contrary to Gandhi's advice, as well as an initiative by senior leader Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari to offer Congress's full support to Britain if it promised Indian independence at the end of the war and installed a democratic government right away. Gandhi had refused to support Britain on the grounds of his moral opposition to war, while Subhas Chandra Bose was in militant opposition to the British. The British rejected Rajagopalachari's initiative, and Patel embraced Gandhi's leadership again.[33] He participated in Gandhi's call for individual disobedience, and was arrested in 1940 and imprisoned for nine months. He also opposed the proposals of the Cripps' mission in 1942. Patel lost more than twenty pounds during his period in jail.


**Role in Partition**

In the 1946 election for the Congress Presidency, Patel was nominated as the candidate for the elections. However, he refused the position on the advice of Gandhi, which was eventually taken over by Jawaharlal Nehru. The election was important in terms of the fact that the elected President would lead free India's first Government.
Patel was free India’s first Home Minister and Minister of Information and Broadcasting. He was also the first of the Congress leaders to support the partition of India, as a solution to curb the rising communal violence and Muslim separatist movement, led by Mohammad Jinnah.
He managed to lobby for the partition successfully, by making Nehru, Gandhi and other Congress leaders accept the proposal. He represented India on the Partition Council, and oversaw the division of public assets. Though patel argued to have agreed for the partition to cease communal violence, little did he anticipate the bloody violence and population transfer that would take place as a result of it.


**Role in India: Post Independence**

At the time of independence, India was divided into three parts. The first was the one directly under control of the British Government, the second was the territories rules by hereditary rulers and third was the territory colonized by France and Portugal.
Patel had realized that the dream for a unified and free India could only be achieved if the three territories were integrated as one. Blessed with practical acumen, great wisdom and political foresight, he took up the uphill task of unifying India.
He began lobbying with the princes and monarchs of the separate states to accede to the government in full faith, who were given two choices by the British – either to join India or Pakistan or stay independently.
Patel’s untiring efforts and relentless appeals reaped fruitful result as he successfully persuaded 565 states, except the three states of Jammu and Kashmir, Junagadh, and Hyderabad. He used the tactics of invoking patriotism in the Indian rulers and proposed favourable terms for the merger
Junagadh on the other hand had acceded to Pakistan. With more than 80% population as Hindu and its distance from Pakistan, Patel demanded Pakistan to annul accession and forced the Nawab of Junagadh to accede to India. Hyderabad too joined the Indian Union by force, after tha Razakar forces failed to match up to the Indian army.
As for Kashmir, it was during the Pakistani invasion of Kashmir in September 1947 that Kashmir's monarch acceded to India. Patel then oversaw India's military operations to secure Srinagar and the Baramulla Pass. In the days to follow, Indian forces retrieved much territory from the invaders.

                                    
Got Princely states into the country
                                    
In his capacity as the home minister, he mobilized all the princely states to surrender to India or run the risk of being annexed, to which most states responded in a positive way

                                  
**Used necessary force in Hyderabad**
                                  
he Hyderabad region, which was ruled by the Nizams, wasn’t ready to become a part of India and wanted to remain independent. Pakistan had got a hint of this and wanted to make the most of the situation but before it could reach that point, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel flew down to Hyderabad and informed the Nizam that the city was surrounded by the police of the India republic and got him to surrender.

           
**Opposed RSS**
           
He was against the idea of letting Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh exist and was one of the very few people to have opposed the hard line Hindu outfit in the press too.

               
**Nehru and Patel**
               
Always a believer in staying behind the scenes and doing the leg work over taking the limelight, he stepped down during the 1946 elections to let Nehru take the complete majority. Rumour has it, he was the front runner to become the prime minister but he stepped down only because Mahatma Gandhi asked him to do so.


Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India and industrialist J. R. D. Tata have expressed the opinion that Patel would have made a better prime minister for India than Nehru.[93] These admirers and Nehru's critics cite Nehru's belated embrace of Patel's advice regarding the UN and Kashmir and the integration of Goa by military action and Nehru's rejection of Patel's advice on China.[94] Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's defence of property rights and his mentorship of what was to be later known as the Amul co operative project.

**Death**

Patel's health declined rapidly through the summer of 1950 and later began coughing blood. He was then flown to Bombay for recovery but suffered a major heart attack and took his last breath on 15th December 1950.

**Influence**

Patel was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, in 1991.[100] It was announced in 2014 that his birthday, 31 October, would become an annual national celebration known as Rashtriya Ekta Diwas (National Unity Day)
Because all these reasons, his birth anniversary is celeberated as National Unity Day.

                                       
**Statue of Unity dedicated to the leader**
                                       
The Statue of Unity is under construction in Gujarat. 597 feet (182 metres) tall, the statue will be the world’s tallest when completed.
